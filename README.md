AI PROMPT FOR THE WEB APP
You are an expert frontend developer.  
Build me a *working website for AfyaAlert*, a Kenyan medicine price and availability tracker.  

### Requirements:
- Use *React + Vite + TailwindCSS* for frontend.
- Clean, modern UI inspired by *health-tech dashboards* (white background, green/blue accents, rounded cards).

   - Hero section: Tagline “Find affordable medicines near you” + search bar
   - Call-to-action buttons: “Search Now” & “Partner with Us”
   - Illustration/healthcare-themed hero image

2. *Medicine Search Page*
   - Search input for medicine name
   - Mock results displayed in a grid of cards:
     - Medicine name, strength, price, pharmacy name, location, availability badge (In-stock/Out of stock)
     - “Reserve” button (click triggers a modal with confirmation)
   - Ability to *filter by location* (dropdown: Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret)

3. *Partner Pharmacies Page*
   - Table/list view showing mock pharmacies with:
     - Pharmacy name, license number, county, status (Verified / Pending Verification)
   - Call-to-action button: “Join as a Partner Pharmacy”

- Smooth animations (Framer Motion).
- Fully responsive.

### Tech Stack
- React (Vite)
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion (for smooth animations)
- Lucide React (for icons)

Output:  
- Full codebase with all pages/components wired up.  
- Dummy JSON file for medicine + pharmacy data.  
- Include comments so I can later connect real APIs (Firebase, REST).

BACKEND PROMPT
with the front end done let us create backend: You are an expert backend engineer. Build me a Node.js + Express + MongoDB backend for a project called "AfyaAlert". 

## Requirements:
- Use Express for the REST API
- Use MongoDB with Mongoose for database models
- Implement JWT-based authentication for users
- Structure the project in MVC style (routes, controllers, models)
- Use environment variables (.env) for sensitive data

## Database Models:
1. User
   - name (string)
   - email (string, unique)
   - password (hashed)
   - role (enum: consumer | pharmacy | admin)

2. Pharmacy
   - name (string)
   - location (string)
   - license (string, unique)
   - verified (boolean, default false)
   - contact (string)

3. Medicine
   - name (string)
   - strength (string)
   - price (number)
   - availability (boolean)
   - pharmacyId (ObjectId ref to Pharmacy)
   - updatedAt (date)

4. Reservation
   - userId (ObjectId ref to User)
   - medicineId (ObjectId ref to Medicine)
   - pharmacyId (ObjectId ref to Pharmacy)
   - status (enum: pending | confirmed | cancelled)
   - createdAt (date)

## API Endpoints:
### Auth
- POST /api/register → Register user
- POST /api/login → Login user (return JWT)

### Users
- GET /api/users/me → Get logged-in user profile

### Pharmacies
- POST /api/pharmacies/register → Register a pharmacy
- GET /api/pharmacies → List pharmacies
- PUT /api/pharmacies/:id/verify → Admin-only: verify a pharmacy

### Medicines
- POST /api/medicines → Add medicine (pharmacy role only)
- GET /api/medicines → List/search medicines (filters: name, location)
- PUT /api/medicines/:id → Update medicine info

### Reservations
- POST /api/reservations → Reserve a medicine
- GET /api/reservations/:userId → Get user reservations

## Security & Validation:
- Use bcrypt to securely hash user passwords.

Implement JWT middleware to safeguard protected routes.

Apply role-based access control for different user types (consumer, pharmacy, and admin).

Use express-validator to ensure all incoming request data is properly validated.

## Setup:
- Include instructions in README for:
  1. npm install
  2. create .env file with MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET
  3. npm run dev (use nodemon)
